"function" keyword is used to define Javascript funcitons

1)Declaration function: it is just simple funciton in Javascript.
funciton declaration is used for later use.When they are called they are going to be used.

Example:
        function multiply(a,b){
            return a * b;
        }
        console.log(multiply(5,7));
2) Expressions function: funtction expression can be stored in variable and the variable can be used as function.

Example:  
        const multiply = funciton(a,b) {return: a * b};
        console.log(multiply(6,8);
when function stored in variable , varaible should be given const to prevent from changing the variable name that now serves as function.

3) Immediately Invoked function-->Functions that ere executed rigth after they are definded

4)High-order functions are those takes other functions as argument and return them.

In Javascript functions can return objects too.

5)Factory function - creates and returns objects
